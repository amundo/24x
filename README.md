# 24x

A web page that tells you how many minutes it will be (according to the schedule) before the 24x will get to the bus loop at UCSB.

This app does not know where buses are. It just compares now to the schedule.

This app has no relationship whatsoever to MTD or the city of Santa Barbara, use at your own risk.
